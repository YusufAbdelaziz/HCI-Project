        Personalize the app experience for individual users, such as by providing personalized health recommendations or medication reminders.

    - Consistency: 
        Ensure that the app's design is consistent throughout, including font styles, colors, and layouts. This makes the app more visually appealing and easier to use.

    - Navigation: 
        The app should have clear and intuitive navigation, with easy-to-find menus and buttons. This allows users to quickly find the information they need.

    - Use of white space:

        Choose typography that is easy to read, such as sans-serif fonts. Ensure that the font size is large enough to be easily readable on smaller screens.

    - Visual hierarchy: 
        Use visual hierarchy to prioritize the most important information, such as appointment details or test results. This helps users quickly find the information they need.

    - Feedback: 
        Provide feedback to users when they perform an action, such as clicking a button. This can be in the form of a pop-up message or a visual cue, such as a loading icon.

    - User testing: 
        Conduct user testing to identify any usability issues and gather feedback from users. This can help identify areas for improvement in the app's user interface.
